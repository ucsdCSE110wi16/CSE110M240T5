Our schedule is in the links within this designDocs folder. 
"Week 7 notes"
"Week 8 notes"

They are links to our Google Docs for our schedule and they act as our Big Board. 
Depending on the Operating System, the GDOC files might download another GDOC
file that will THEN take you to our Weekly schedules. 

If it doesn't work, just use the links:
