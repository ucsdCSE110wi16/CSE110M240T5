below
#########################################




--------------------------------------------------------------------------
From Week 6
What we have:
	Login Screen
	Registration
	Post-Login Screenn
	Database connection

What we wanted to work on were the following:
	1) Events page: scrollable, list format, e.g. Reddit
	2) Create an Activity
		- XML and Parse
		- When an event is created, the event should show up
		in the main events page.
	3) Filter
	4) Expanded Page
		- Push to Parse (should be trivial)
	5) Learn more about retrieval from Parse.
	6) Scrolling
		- Pages or Endless Scroll?

TODO: User stories for these goals. 








--------------------------------------------------------------------------
From Week 5
Flow of the Application:  Browsing -> Joining -> Creating 
Components: Front End, Back End, Be able to hold the different events, GPS 

#Logging In
- As a user, I want to login with my UCSD email address 
so that I can gain access to the UCSD event community (Med)

- As a user I want to receive email confirmation so 
 that I know the event network is secure(Low)

- As a user I want to be able to recover my account so 
that I can reset my password or email(Low)



#Browsing event (High) 
As a user, I want to see activities of nearby students at UCSD 
so that I can see events on campus
(at UCSD – Email address)


#Creating Post
As a user I want to be able to create a post with a category 
so that people can find it easier



#Joining event
As a user seeking an activity, I want to be able to browse activities 
by most recent first because I want to see what events are still relevant.  



#Extending the Usage of the Application 
As a user, I want the application to detect my location so that 
I can look for local events. 
(GPS Location of user as well as GPS location of other users) 


Scenarios: 

Given I have the app opened and GPS location enabled
when I search events
then I see a list of events near me with people looking to 
participate in cool stuff with them. 

Given I have the app opened on the events page
when I click on the search icon
then the search bar appears at the top
when I type "smash bros" into a search bar
then I see a list of groups looking to play smash bros


Given I have the app opened on the events page
when I click the location icon
then GPS is enabled
when I search for an event
then events appear sorted by those soonest and within a certain radius








--------------------------------------------------------------------------
From week 4:
As a user, I want to login with my ucsd email address 

As a user, I want the application to detect my location.

As a user, I want to see activities of nearby students at UCSD - 
(Is this at UCSD or GPS location?) 

As a user seeking others, I want to be able to create a post looking 
for a person to enjoy an activity with me so that the activity I want 
to partake in is possible/ more enjoyable (how about choosing a 
category/filter for your post to be in?) 


As a user seeking an activity, I want to be able to browse activities
 until I find one I wish to participate in so that I can contact the 
 poster and ask to join. (What will contacting the poster be like 
 - should be another user story) 

I open the app, turn on my GPS location, and see a list of people near
 me looking for people to participate in cool stuff with them. 
 (You see a list of other people using GPS? might be a hard deliverable) 

I open the app, type in “smash bros” and see a list of groups near me 
looking to play smash bros (Talk more about the search function 
-- need to break this up more) 


I open the app, type in “smash bros” and my location and see a list 
of groups near me looking to play smash bros (How many filters will 
there be/will they be user created)
