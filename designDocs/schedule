Notes 2/7/2016
Java dynamic

What we have so far:
-Login Screen
-Registration works
-Post-Login Screen
-Database connection

What we need to do:
-Create an activity page
*** Events page(scrollable, list format, like reddit or something) <- #1 priority
-Filter feature
-Pushing to Parse should be trivial 
-Learn more about the retrieval from Parse




Schedule
