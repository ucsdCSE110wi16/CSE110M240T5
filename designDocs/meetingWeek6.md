Stinder

Completed milestones this week:
	-Swipe functionality implemented
	-Dummy accounts added
	-Account matching functional
		-Although no matching algorithm
	-Created account creation page
		-Has functionality to add and remove classes and name
		-Still has to implement profile picture uploading
Schedule for next week
	-Want to implement real accounts
	-Matching algorithm
	-We want to prioritize messaging and blocking over endorsement
	-Messaging should be done week 8?
	-Whatever schedule they have is good.
		-Have matching algorithm done by next week
What we want
	-Melissa asked for the opposite button to disappear when pressed. 
	(As a user, I want to press the button for matching and then have 
	the other button disappear so that I can’t press both buttons)

	-We want to have endless account matching. If we have already 
	swiped left on someone, we want them to be placed into the back
	 of the queue 

	-In the user creation page, the user can also add more information 
	(whereas in Tinder, this information would be pulled from Facebook.
	 No need for second page.)
