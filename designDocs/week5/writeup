UpUrVent(tentative title) is a program that allows students to see relevant e
vents and get in contact with the people hosting the events. Students will sign
up using their ucsd.edu email address and be shown a list of events hosted by
other students. The user will initially see the events ordered based on the time
they start, with the events starting the soonest near the top. They will be able
to scroll down and see / load more events, and also be able to filter events
based on keywords such as "Smash Bros" or "CSE110 Study". A user will be able to
tap on an event to come to a detailed view, and see more information about it.
An event will contain information such as a title, description, creator, RSVP
information, capacity(if there is a limit on the number of attendees will also
display the number of spots left), date, time, location, and attendees. 
Upon opening the descriptive view the user will be able to "join" the event 
which will add them to the list of attendees. Users will also be able to create
and post their own events by filling out some basic info (date, time, title) and
additional information should they choose. By default, people will be able to 
RSVP to the event creators registered email, unless the event creator adds
additional contact information.
